# HerHackopedia 
Things or people we mentioned that may need further clarification.

## What it is:
Introducing HerHackopedia! A public GitHub repository where all of our podcast lore and terms are defined. Our mission is to make cybersecurity easier to digest at any level of experience. HerHackopedia is a space where we define terms mentioned in episodes and categorize them in a text based format. 

## How to use it:
Terms are segmented by episode in mark down files (.md) and listed in order of appearance with a definition by one of our HerHax cohosts or you! (See below) 

## How you can contribute <3:
Please star and submit a pull request to our repository for any corrections, additional terms you want us to define, further definitions authored by you (will be given credit), or general edits that you want to see! Not all of our episodes are categorized yet, as this is a WIP (work in progress).
