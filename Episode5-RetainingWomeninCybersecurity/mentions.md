HerHaxPodcast asked me which makeup product is my HG (holy grail). I consistenly rely on the Nars Soft Matte concealer:

The book we talked about on technical writing is titled *Writing Technical Reports* by Bruce M. Cooper. I get most of my books from AbeBooks.com so I can buy second hand. 

My favorite YouTuber, though not cyber security related, is [Samantha Ravndahl](https://www.youtube.com/@samantharavndahl). She talks a lot about mental health, which we all need to deal with the toxicity that exists in this field. 

Lastly, [here](https://github.com/sheilman16/herhackopedia/blob/ed2f5430e797d1de5941785dc21990d6af995338/Episode5-RetainingWomeninCybersecurity/idioms.md) is the list of corporate idioms and military jargon I collected during my time at MITRE. 


If there is anything missing, submit a PR and I'll fill in the blanks!
