# Hi, these are the things I mentioned during my interview with HerHaxPodcast

HerHax asked me which makeup product is a HG (holy grail). I consistenly rely on the Nars Soft Matte concealer:

The book we talked about on technical writing is titled *Writing Technical Reports* by Bruce M. Cooper. I get most of my books from AbeBooks.com so I can buy second hand. 

Lastly, [here](https://github.com/sheilman16/herhackopedia/blob/ed2f5430e797d1de5941785dc21990d6af995338/Episode5-RetainingWomeninCybersecurity/idioms.md) is the list of corporate idioms and military jargon I collected during my time at MITRE.
